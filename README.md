Solution to the 2016 TCO Marathon - Round 2

This is my solution to the 2016 TCO Marathon match - Round 2.

The problem statement can be found under:
https://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&compid=52176&rd=16703

StarTraveller.cpp is a simple greedy approach.
StarTravellerExtended.cpp is an extended version of the greedy approach. It uses an 2-opt approach to solve
the traveling salesman problems. It also has some stochastic (Metropolis algortihm) elements in it.

The most recent solution is the StarTravellerCombinedMethods.cpp file. It combines all the above methods and
extends/speeds up the Matropolis approach.

You can use the main.py script to run an onsite test with the StarTravellerVis.java tester 
which you can download from the above contest page.
